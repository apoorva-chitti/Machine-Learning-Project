# Machine Learning Project
For Senior Design CS 4485, Team 6. Online Tutoring Application for Dr. Pushpa Kumar.

## MVP's
- Tutors will need to register for a tutor account. 
- Only tutors with non-criminal backgrounds will be accepted. 
- A tutor will then enter their detailed information (subject list, about me, available times).
- When tutors login after initial registration, two-factor authentication is required to ensure the security of their online account beyond just a username and password.
- Users will be able to make appointments with a tutor of their choice. 
- Both users and tutors will be able to see list of upcoming appointments and cancel the appointment if needed.
- This application will have the ability to generate reports detailing all sessions
completed by a tutor.

## Stretch Goals
