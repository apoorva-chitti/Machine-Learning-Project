# Machine Learning Project
Final Project for CS 4375 in collaboration with Elliana Brown. For Dr.Feng Chen's class.

## Description
This repository contains the implementation and analysis of a comparative study of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The project focuses on evaluating the performance of two widely used CNN architectures, AlexNet and VGG-16, alongside a newly proposed CNN model. The study benchmarks these models on three datasets: MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10. 

It includes:
- Code for the proposed CNN and the comparative experiments.
- The final report, which includes:
  - Comprehensive explanations of the CNN architectures and datasets.
  - Details on training methodologies and data preprocessing techniques.
  - Performance metrics and test results, highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of each model.

## End Goal
- Write a paper with your findings on the CNNs, with a thorough analysis and proofs.
- Present your findings to a selected panel and your peers.

## Technical Stack
- Language: Python
- Environment/IDE: Jupyter Notebooks
    
## Participants
- Apoorva Chittimoori
